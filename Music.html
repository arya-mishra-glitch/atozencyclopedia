		<dd><font size=4>Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.It is one of the universal cultural 
aspects of all human societies. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated
 concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color"
 of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. 

<p>Music is performed with a vast range of 
instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental
 accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousiké; "(art) of the Muses").</p>

<p>In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on),
 the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music in two parts: 
melodies, as tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to my ears"
 point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for
 example, "There is no noise, only sound."</font></p></dd></dl></ul>

<dd><font size=4>The word 'music' is derived from Ancient Greek μουσική (mousiké) '(art) of the Muses'. In Greek mythology, the nine Muses were the goddesses 
who inspired literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture.

<p> According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the term music is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from Old French musique  and directly from Latin musica 
'the art of music', also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish música, Italian musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)." 
This is derived from the "...Greek mousike (techne) '(art) of the Muses,' from fem. of mousikos 'pertaining to the Muses', from Mousa 'Muse'. 
Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece, [the term 'music' refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and lyric poetry."

	<B><li><font color=#000033 face="Copperplate Gothic Light" size = 5>EARLY INDIAN MUSIC CONCEPTIONS</FONT></li><BR></B>
<DD><font size=4>From historical accounts it is clear that the power to move people has always been attributed to music; its ecstatic possibilities have been recognized in all 
cultures and have usually been admitted in practice under particular conditions, sometimes stringent ones. In India, music has been put into the service of religion
 from earliest times; Vedic hymns stand at the beginning of the record. 

<P>As the art developed over many centuries into a music of profound melodic and rhythmic 
intricacy, the discipline of a religious text or the guideline of a story determined the structure. In the 21st century the narrator remains central to the performance
 of much Indian traditional music, and the virtuosity of a skillful singer rivals that of the instrumentalists.
The vertical dimension of chord structure—that is, the effects created by sounding tones simultaneously the divisions of an octave (intervals) are more numerous 
, and the melodic complexity of the music goes far beyond that of its Western
 counterpart. Moreover, an element of improvisation is retained that is vital to the success of a performance. The spontaneous imitation carried on between an 
instrumentalist and narrator, against the insistent rhythmic subtleties of the drums, can be a source of the greatest excitement, which in large measure is because of
 the faithful adherence to the rigid rules that govern the rendition of ragas—the ancient melodic patterns of Indian music.</p></font></dd></dl></ul>

	<B><li><font color=#000033 face="Copperplate Gothic Light" size = 5>INDIAN CLASSICAL MUSIC</FONT></li><BR></B>
<DD> <font size=4><img src ="musicimage.jpg" style=float:right height=300>The two main traditions of Indian classical music are Carnatic music, which is practised predominantly in the peninsular (southern) regions, 
and Hindustani music,
 which is found in the northern, eastern and central regions. The basic concepts of this music includes Shruti (microtones), Swaras (notes), Alankar (ornamentations), 
Raga (melodies improvised from basic grammars), and Tala (rhythmic patterns used in percussion). Its tonal system divides the octave into 22 segments called Shrutis,
 not all equal but each roughly equal to a quarter of a whole tone of the Western music. 

<P>Both the classical music are standing on the fundamentals of The seven notes of Indian Classical music. These seven notes are also called as Sapta svara or Sapta Sur.
These seven svaras are Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni respectively. These Sapta
 Svaras are spelt as Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha and Ni, but these are shortforms of Shadja (षड्ज), Rishabha (ऋषभ), Gandhara (गान्धार), Madhyama (मध्यम), Panchama (पंचम), Dhaivata
 (धैवत) and Nishada (निषाद) respectively. Only these seven svaras built up the Hindustani classical music and the
 Carnatic classical music. These seven svaras are the fundamentals of a raga. This seven svaras without any variations in them, are called as Shuddha svaras. Variations in 
these svaras cause them to be Komal and Tivra svaras. All the other svaras except Sadja(Sa) and Pancham (Pa) can be Komal or Tivra svaras but Sa and Pa are always
 Shuddha svaras. And hence svaras Sa and Pa are called Achal Svaras, since these svaras don't move from their original position while svaras Ra, Ga, Ma, Dha, Ni are
 called Chal Svaras, since these svaras move from their original position.</P></p></font></dd></dl></ul>

	<B><li><font color=#000033 face="Copperplate Gothic Light" size = 5>POPULAR MUSIC IN INDIA</FONT></li><BR></b>
<DD> <font size=4>The biggest form of Indian popular music is filmi, or songs from Indian films, it makes up 72% of the music sales in India. The film industry of India 
supported music by according reverence to classical music while utilising the western orchestration to support Indian melodies. Music composers, like R. D. Burman, 
 S. D. Burman,  Madan Mohan, , Hemant Kumar, A. R. Rahman, Jatin Lalit, Anu Malik and others employed the principles of harmony while retaining classical and folk 
flavor. Reputed names in the domain of Indian classical music like Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, Ali Akbar Khan and Ram Narayan have also composed music for films. 
 Traditionally, in Indian films, the voice for the songs is not provided by the actors, they are provided by the professional playback singers, to sound more developed,
 melodious and soulful,<img src="musicimage2.jpeg" style=float:right height=200> while actors lipsynch on the screen. In the past, only a handful of singers provided the voice in films.<p>

These include Kishore Kumar, K. J. Yesudas 
, Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, T.M. Soundararajan, Hemant Kumar, Manna Dey, P. Susheela, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle, K.S. Chitra,
