<dd><font size=4>A drama is the portrayal of fictional or non-fictional events through the performance of written dialog (either prose or poetry). Dramas can be
 performed on stage, on film, or the radio. Dramas are typically called plays, and their creators are known as “playwrights” or “dramatists.” 
<p>Performed since the days of Aristotle the term “drama” comes from the Greek words δρᾶμα (an act, a play) and δράω (to act, to take action). The two iconic 
masks of drama—the laughing face and the crying face—are the symbols of two of the ancient Greek Muses: Thalia, the Muse of comedy and Melpomene, the 
Muse of tragedy.</p>
<p>Drama is literature intended for performance. The form is combined with music and dance in opera and musical theatre (see libretto). A play is a written dramatic
 work by a playwright that is intended for performance in a theatre; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters. A closet drama, by contrast, is written to be
 read rather than to be performed; the meaning of which can be realized fully on the page.Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.</p>
<p>The earliest form of which there exists substantial knowledge is Greek drama. This developed as a performance associated with religious and civic festivals,
 typically enacting or developing upon well-known historical, or mythological themes. In the twentieth century scripts written for non-stage media have been added to 
this form, including radio, television and film.</p></dd></dl></ul>
