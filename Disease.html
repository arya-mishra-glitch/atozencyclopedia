		<dd><font size=4>A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, 
and that is not due to any immediate external injury. Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms. A 
disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a 
variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders.

<p>In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, 
or similar problems for those in contact with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated 
symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable
 categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life.</p>

<p>Death due to disease is called death by natural causes. There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases 
(including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases. Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable 
versus non-communicable diseases. The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and 
lower respiratory infections. In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and 
anxiety.</p></dd></dl></ul>

<dd><font size=4>Diseases may be classified by cause, pathogenesis (mechanism by which the disease is caused), or by symptom(s). Alternatively, diseases may be classified 
according to the organ system involved, though this is often complicated since many diseases affect more than one organ.

<p>A chief difficulty in nosology is that diseases often cannot be defined and classified clearly, especially when cause or pathogenesis are unknown. Thus diagnostic terms 
often only reflect a symptom or set of symptoms (syndrome).</p>

<p>Classical classification of human disease derives from the observational correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes. Today it is preferred to 
classify them by their cause if it is known.</P>

<p>The most known and used classification of diseases is the World Health Organization's ICD. This is periodically updated. Currently, the last publication is the ICD-11.</p></font></dd></dl></ul>

<dd><font size=4>Only some diseases such as influenza are contagious and commonly believed infectious. The microorganisms that cause these diseases are known 
as pathogens and include varieties of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. Infectious diseases can be transmitted, e.g. by hand-to-mouth contact with infectious
 material on surfaces, by bites of insects or other carriers of the disease, and from contaminated water or food (often via fecal contamination), etc.
 Also, there are sexually transmitted diseases. In some cases, microorganisms that are not readily spread from person to person play a role, while other diseases
 can be prevented or ameliorated with appropriate nutrition or other lifestyle changes.

<p>Some diseases, such as most (but not all) forms of cancer, heart disease, and mental disorders, are non-infectious diseases. Many non-infectious diseases have a 
partly or completely genetic basis (see genetic disorder) and may thus be transmitted from one generation to another.</p>

<p>Social determinants of health are the social conditions in which people live that determine their health. Illnesses are generally related to social, economic, political, 
and environmental circumstances. Social determinants of health have been recognized by several health organizations such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and
 the World Health Organization to greatly influence collective and personal well-being. The World Health Organization's Social Determinants Council also recognizes 
Social determinants of health in poverty.</p>

<p>When the cause of a disease is poorly understood, societies tend to mythologize the disease or use it as a metaphor or symbol of whatever that culture considers 
evil. For example, until the bacterial cause of tuberculosis was discovered in 1882, experts variously ascribed the disease to heredity, a sedentary lifestyle, depressed
mood, and overindulgence in sex, rich food, or alcohol, all of which were social ills at the time.</p>

<p>When a disease is caused by a pathogenic organism (e.g., when malaria is caused by Plasmodium), one should not confuse the pathogen (the cause of the disease) 
with disease itself. For example, West Nile virus (the pathogen) causes West Nile fever (the disease). The misuse of basic definitions in epidemiology is frequent in 
scientific publications. </p></font></dd></dl></ul>

<dd><font size=4><img src="Diseaseimage.jpeg" alt="Coronavirus" style="float:right ; height:270" >Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.

<P>Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache,fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms may begin one
 to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop 
symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms
 (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). 
Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery,
 and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.</P></font></dd></dl></ul>
