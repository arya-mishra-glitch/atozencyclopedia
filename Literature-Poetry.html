<dd> <font size=4><img src="Poetryimage.png" style="float:right ; height:230">Poetry, literature that evokes a concentrated imaginative awareness of experience or a specific emotional response through language 
chosen and arranged for its meaning, sound, and rhythm.
<P>Poetry (derived from the Greek poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic qualities of language 
− such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre − to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, a prosaic ostensible meaning.
Poetry has a long and varied history, evolving differentially across the globe. It dates back at least to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa, and to panegyric 
and elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile, Niger, and Volta River valleys.Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa occurs among the Pyramid Texts written
during the 25th century BCE. The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian.</P>
