<font size=4>The word "flora" comes from the Latin name of Flora, the goddess of plants, flowers, and fertility in Roman mythology. The technical term "flora" is 
then derived from a metonymy of this goddess at the end of the sixteenth century. It was first used in poetry to denote the natural vegetation of an area, but soon 
also assumed the meaning of a work cataloguing such vegetation. Moreover, "Flora" was used to refer to the flowers of an artificial garden in the seventeenth century.

<p>The distinction between vegetation (the general appearance of a community) and flora (the taxonomic composition of a community) was first made by Jules 
Thurmann (1849). Prior to this, the two terms were used indiscriminately.</p></dd></dl></ul>

<font size=4>Flora can be subdivided into special classifications: 
<img src="Floraimage2.jpeg"  style="float:right ; height:250" >
<DL COMPACT><DT>Native Flora</DT>
<DD> Native flora  refers to the indigenous or native flora in a specific area.</DD>
<DT>Weed Flora</DT>
<DD>Weed Flora is usually used in reference to undesirable plants, those which humans wish to remove from a particular region. This term has somewhat fallen out of favor, as it actually refers to
 different kinds of plants including invasive species, native species that interfere with agriculture, and weedy species.</DD>
<DT> Horticultural Flora</DT>
<DD> Horticultural flora refers to the flora that is cultivated by humans for use, so it refers to agricultural plants.</DD></DL>  
The term flora can also be used to refer to publication containing documentation on the plants within a region.
