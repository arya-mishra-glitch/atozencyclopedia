<dd>
<font size=4> Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry. In recent centuries,
 the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed.Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment, and can also have a social,
 psychological,spiritual, or political role.
<p>Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as biography, diaries, memoir, letters, and the essay. Within  its broad definition, literature includes non-fictional books, articles or 
other printed information on a particular subject.</p>
<p>Literature (from the Latin Littera meaning 'letters' and referring to an acquaintance with the written word) is the written work of a specific ,culture sub-culture, religion, philosophy or the study of such written work 
which may appear in poetry or in prose. Literature, in the west, originated in thesouthern Mesopotamia region of Sumer in the city of Uruk and flourished in Egypt, later in Greece (the written word having been imported 
there from the Phoenicians) and from there, to Rome. </p></dd></dl></ul>

<dd>Literature is a form of human expression. But not everything expressed in words—even when organized and written down—is counted as literature.
Those writings that are primarily informative—technical, scholarly, journalistic—would be excluded from the rank of literature by most, though not all, critics.
Certain forms of writing, however, are universally regarded as belonging to literature as an art. Individual attempts within these forms are said to succeed if they 
possess something called artistic merit and to fail if they do not. The nature of artistic merit is less easy to define than to recognize. The writer need not even 
pursue it to attain it. On the contrary, a scientific exposition might be of great literary value and a pedestrian poem of none at all.</dl></ul>
