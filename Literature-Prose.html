		<dd>

<font size=4>Prose is a form of written or spoken language that typically exhibits a natural flow of speech and grammatical structure. A related narrative device is the stream of consciousness, which also flows naturally but is not concerned with 
syntax. The word "prose" first appears in English in the 14th century. It is derived from the Old French prose, which in turn originates in the Latin expression prosa oratio (literally, straightforward or direct speech). Works of philosophy, history,
 economics, etc.., journalism, and most fiction (an exception is the verse novel), are examples of works written in prose. 
<p>It differs from most traditional poetry, where the form has a regular structure, consisting of verse based on metre and rhyme. However, developments in twentieth century literature, including free verse, concrete poetry, and prose poetry,
 have led to the idea of poetry and prose as two ends on a spectrum rather than firmly distinct from each other. The American 
poet T. S. Eliot noted, whereas "the distinction between verse and prose is clear, the distinction between poetry and prose is obscure."</p></dd></dl></ul>

<dd><font size=4>Prose usually lacks the more formal metrical structure of the verses found in traditional poetry. It comprises full grammatical sentences (other than in stream of consciousness narrative), and paragraphs, whereas poetry often 
involves a metrical or rhyming scheme. Some works of prose make useof rhythm and verbal music. Verse is normally more systematic or formulaic, while prose is closer to both ordinary, and conversational speech. 
<P>In Molière's play Le Bourgeois gentilhomme the character Monsieur Jourdain asked for something to be written in neither verse nor prose, to which a philosophy master replies: "there is no other way to express oneself than with prose or
 verse", for the simple reason that "everything that is not prose is verse, and everything that is not verse is prose". </p></dd></dl></ul>

	<li><font color=#000033 face="Copperplate Gothic Light" size = 5><B> EARLY TRANSLATIONS INTO ENGLISH	</font></B></li>
<dd><font size=4>The earliest literary prose dates from the late 9th century, when King Alfred, eager to improve the state of English learning, led a vigorous program to translate into English “certain books that are necessary for all men to
 know.” Alfred himself translated the Pastoral Care of St. Gregory I the Great, the Consolation of Philosophy of Boethius, the Soliloquies of St. Augustine of Hippo, and the first 50 Psalms. His Pastoral Care is a fairly literal translation, but his 
Boethius is extensively restructured and revised to make explicit the Christian message that medieval commentators saw in that work. He revised the Soliloquies even more radically, departing from his source to draw from Gregory and
 St. Jerome, as well as from other works by Augustine. Alfred’s prefaces to these works are of great historical interest.
<P>At Alfred’s urging, Bishop Werferth of Worcester translated the Dialogues of Gregory; probably Alfred also inspired anonymous scholars to translate Bede’s Historia ecclesiastica and Paulus Orosius’s Historiarum adversum paganos
libri vii . Both of these works are much abridged; the Bede translation follows its source slavishly, but the translator of Orosius added many details of northern European geography These accounts, in addition to their geographical interest, show
 that friendly commerce between England and Scandinavia was possible even during the Danish wars. </P>
<P>The entries covering the Danish wars of the late 9th century are much fuller, and those running from the reign of Ethelred II to the Norman Conquest in 1066 (when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle exists in several versions) contain many 
passages of excellent writing. The early 10th century is not notable for literary production, but some of the homilies in the Vercelli Book and the Blickling Manuscript (Scheide Library, Princeton University) may belong to that period. </p></dd>

		<DD><font size=4><img src="Proseimage.jpg" style="float:right ; height:300">A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, typically written in prose and published as a book. The present English word for a long 
		work of prose fiction derives from the Italian: novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the Latin: novella, a 
		singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning "new".
		<P>According to Margaret Doody, the novel has "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years", with its origins in the 
		Ancient Greek and Roman novel, in Chivalric romance, and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance novella.  Some, including M. H. Abrams and 
		Walter Scott, have argued that a novel is a fiction narrative that displays a realistic depiction of the state of a society, while the romance encompasses 
		any fictitious narrative that emphasizes marvellous or uncommon incidents.</P>
		<P>Works of fiction that include marvellous or uncommon incidents are also novels, including The Lord of The Rings, To Kill a Mockingbird,
		 and Frankenstein. "Romances" are works of fiction whose main emphasis is on marvellous or unusual incidents, and should not be confused 
		with the romance novel, a type of genre fiction that focuses on romantic love.</P></DD></DL>

	<LI><DL><DT><b><font  face="Copperplate Gothic Light" > NOVELLA</FONT></b></DT></LI>
	<DD>A novella is a narrative prose fiction whose length is shorter than that of most novels, but longer than most short stories. The English word novella 
	derives from the Italian novella, feminine of novello, which means "new".
	<p>The novella as a literary genre began developing in the Italian literature of the early Renaissance, principally Giovanni Boccaccio, author of The Decameron
	 (1353). The Decameron featured 100 tales  fleeing the Black Death, by escaping from 
	Florence to the Fiesole hills in 1348. This structure was then imitated by subsequent authors.</p>
	<p>The Italian genre novella grew out of a rich tradition of medieval short narrative forms. It took its first major form in the anonymous late 13th century 
	Libro di novelle et di bel parlar gentile, known as the Novellino, and reached its culmination with The Decameron.The Italian novella influenced 
	many later writers, including Shakespeare.</p>
	<p>Novellas were also written in Spain. Miguel de Cervantes book Novelas ejemplares (1613) added innovation to the genre with more attention to 
	depiction of human character and social background to the action.
	<P>Not until the late 18th and early 19th centuries did writers fashion the novella into a literary genre structured by precepts and rules, generally in a realistic
	 mode. At that time, the Germans were the most active writers of the novelle (German: "Novelle"; plural: "Novellen").  Novellen tend to contain a concrete 
	symbol, which is the narrative's focal point.</P></DD></DL>

	<LI><DL><DT><b><font  face="Copperplate Gothic Light" > SHORT STORY</FONT></b></DT></LI>
	<DD>A short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked incidents, 
	with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood. The short story is one of the oldest types of literature and has existed in the form of legends, mythic tales, 
	folk tales,fairy tales, fables and anecdotes in various ancient communities around the world. The modern short story developed in the early 19th century.
	<P>In terms of length, word count is typically anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 for short stories, however some have 15,000 words and are still classed as short
	 stories. Stories of fewer than 1,000 words are sometimes referred to as "short short stories", or "flash fiction".</P>
	<P>Short stories have no set length. In terms of word count, there is no official demarcation between an anecdote, a short story, and a novel. Rather, the 
	form's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered so that what constitutes a short 
	story may differ between genres, countries, eras, and commentators.<P></DD></DL>

	<LI><DL><DT><b><font  face="Copperplate Gothic Light" >GRAPHIC NOVEL </FONT></b></DT></LI>
	<DD>A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word "novel" normally refers to long fictional works, the term "graphic novel" is 
	applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work."Graphic Novel" is a format, not a genre. Graphic novels can be fiction, non-fiction,
	history, fantasy, or anything in-between.
	<P>Graphic novels are similar to comic books because they use sequential art to tell a story. Unlike comic books, graphic novels are generally stand-alone 
	stories with more complex plots. Collections of short stories that have been previously published as individual comic books are also considered graphic
	 novels.</P>
	<DL><DT>Like traditional novels there are endless ways to categorize different graphic novels. There are as many genres and sub-genres as in traditional
	 fiction and non-fiction. The following are only a few of the most predominant categories:</DT><BR>
	<DD><img src="Proseimage3.jpg" alt="Manga" style="float:left ; height:130" ></P>MANGA: The Japanese word for "comic" but in the US is used to descript Japanese style comics. Manga is read from top to bottom and right to left as
	 this is the traditional Japanese reading pattern. 
	<P>SUPERHERO STORY: Superhero graphic novels have taken the most popular form of comics and turned what were once brief episodic <img src="Proseimage2.gif" style="float:right ; height:150" alt="Marvel Comics">
	adventures into epic sagas. Superhero comics are dominated by a few mainstream publishers Marvel, DC, and Darkhorse.
	<P>PERSONAL NARRATIVES : are autobiographical stories written from the author's personal experiences, opinions, and observations.
	<P>NON FICTION: are similar to perzine's in that they are written from the author's personal experience, but the author is generally using their 
	own experience to touch upon a greater social issue.<P></DD></DL></P></DD></DL>

	<LI><DL><DT><b><font  face="Copperplate Gothic Light" > ELECTRONIC LITERATURE</FONT></b></DT></LI>
	<DD>Electronic literature or digital literature is a genre of literature encompassing works created exclusively on and for digital devices, such as computers, 
	tablets, and mobile phones. A work of electronic literature can be defined as "a construction whose literary aesthetics emerge from computation", 
	"work that could only exist in the space for which it was developed/written/coded—the digital space". This means that these writings cannot be easily 
	printed, or cannot be printed at all, because elements crucial to the text are unable to be carried over onto a printed version. 
	<p>The digital literature world 
	continues to innovate print's conventions all the while challenging the boundaries between digitized literature and electronic literature. Some novels are 
	exclusive to tablets and smartphones for the simple fact that they require a touchscreen. Digital literature tends to require a user to traverse through the 
	literature through the digital setting, making the use of the medium part of the literary exchange.<P></DD></DL>
<hr color=black noshade=nosade hspace=3 >

	<LI><DL><DT><b><font  face="Copperplate Gothic Light" >NON FICTION </FONT></b></DT></LI>
	<DD>Nonfictional prose, any literary work that is based mainly on fact, even though it may contain fictional elements. Examples are the essay and biography.
	<P>Defining nonfictional prose literature is an immensely challenging task. This type of literature differs from bald statements of fact, such as those 
	recorded in an old chronicle or inserted in a business letter or in an impersonal message of mere information. As used in a broad sense, the term nonfictional
	 prose literature here designates writing intended to instruct , to persuade, to convert, or to convey experience or reality through “factual” or spiritual
	 revelation. Separate articles cover biography and literary criticism.<P></DD></DL></OL></UL>
