<font size=4>Science (from Latin scientia 'knowledge') is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and 
predictions about the universe.<BR>

<P>The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, <img src="Scienceimage2.png" alt="Manga" style="float:right ; height:250" >
 and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the 
physical world based on natural causes.After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe
 during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.</P>

<P>The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural philosophy",
 which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century[10] as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek 
conceptions and traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional
 and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of "natural philosophy" to "natural science." </P>

<P>Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature
 in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences 
(e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which deal with symbols governed by rules. There is disagreement, however, on whether the formal 
sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence. Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as
 engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.</font></p></dd></dl></ul>

	</li>


		<DD><font size=4>Science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations. Modern science is distinct in its approach 
and successful in its results, so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term. Science in its original sense was a word for a type of 
knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge.

<p> In particular, it was the type of knowledge that people can communicate to each 
other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex 
abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, public works at a national scale, such as 
those which harnessed the floodplain of the Yangtse with reservoirs, dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids. </p>

<p>However, no consistent consciousdistinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of 
communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems. Metallurgy was known in prehistory, and the Vinča culture was the earliest known producer of
 bronze-like alloys. It is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into alchemy.</font></p></dd></dl></ul>

	</li>


		<DD><font size=4>New developments in optics played a role in the inception of the Renaissance, both by challenging long-held metaphysical ideas on 
perception, as well as by contributing to the improvement and development of technology such as the camera obscura and the telescope. Before what we now
 know as the Renaissance started, Roger Bacon, Vitello, and John Peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation,
 perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle. A model of vision later known as perspectivism was exploited and 
studied by the artists of the Renaissance. This theory uses only three of Aristotle's four causes: formal, material, and final.

<P>In the sixteenth century, Copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of Ptolemy's Almagest. This was based on a
 theorem that the orbital periods of the planets are longer as their orbs are farther from the centre of motion, which he found not to agree with Ptolemy's model.</P>

<P>Kepler and others challenged the notion that the only function of the eye is perception, and shifted the main focus in optics from the eye to the propagation 
of light.  Kepler modelled the eye as a water-filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil. He found that all the light from a single 
point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye. Kepler is best known,
however, for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics
 and described his work as a search for the Harmony of the Spheres.</P>

<P>Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican
 system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems", 
which greatly offended Urban VIII.</P>

<P>In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with
contemporary ideas of nature. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes 
emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature. Bacon emphasized the importance of 
experiment over contemplation. Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study
 the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "formal cause", of each complex type of thing. This new science
 began to see itself as describing "laws of nature". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic. Bacon also argued that science should aim for
 the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.</font></p></dd></dl></ul>

		<DD><font size=4>The Human Genome Project was completed in 2003, determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA,
 and identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome. Induced pluripotent stem cells were developed in 2006, a technology allowing adult cells to be 
transformed into stem cells capable of giving rise to any cell type found in the body, potentially of huge importance to the field of regenerative medicine.

<P>With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the last particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics was found. In 2015, gravitational waves, predicted 
by general relativity a century before, were first observed.</P>

<P>In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope Observatory announced its first results in simultaneous press conferences around the world on April 10, 2019. Press conferences 
presented the first direct image of a black hole, where the supermassive black hole appeared in the heart of the galaxy Messier 87, which is 55 million light-years away
 from Earth. The scientific findings are presented in a series of six papers published in The Astrophysical Journal.</font></P></p></dd></dl></ul>

<font size=4>Modern science is commonly divided into three major branches: natural science, social science,<IMG SRC="Scienceimage.png" style=float:right height=180> 

and formal science. Each of these branches comprises 
 various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise. Both natural and social sciences are 
empirical sciences, as their knowledge is based on empirical observations and is capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working
 under the same conditions. It is divided majorly into three parts: <ul>
<li><a href="Science-formal.html" >Formal sciences</a></li>
<li><a href="Science-Natural.html" >Natural sciences</a></li>
<li><a href="Science-Social.html" >Social sciences</a></li></ul>

<p>There are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as engineering and medicine, which are sometimes described as applied sciences.
