	<dd><font size=4> Formal science is a branch of science studying formal language disciplines concerned with formal systems, such as logic, mathematics, 
statistics, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, information theory, game theory, systems theory, decision theory, and theoretical linguistics.
Whereas the natural sciences and social sciences seek to characterize physical systems and social systems, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences
 are language tools concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by symbolic systems. The formal sciences aid the natural science, social science and 
actuarial science all through providing information about the structures used to describe the physical and the contemporary world, and what inferences may be made 
about them.</font></p></dd></dl></ul>

	<dd><font size=4> As opposed to empirical sciences (natural and social), the formal sciences do not involve empirical procedures. They also do not 
presuppose knowledge of contingent facts, or describe the real world. In this sense, formal sciences are both logically and methodologically a priori, for their content 
and validity are independent of any empirical procedures.

<P>Therefore, straightly speaking, formal science is not an empirical science. It is a formal logical system with its content targeted at components of experiential 
reality, such as information and thoughts. As Francis Bacon pointed out in the 17th century, experimental verification of the propositions must be carried out 
rigorously and cannot take logic itself as the way to draw conclusions in nature. Formal science is a method that is helpful to empirical science but cannot replace 
empirical science. </P>

<p>Although formal sciences are conceptual systems, lacking empirical content, this does not mean that they have no relation to the real world. But this relation is
 such that their formal statements hold in all possible conceivable worlds â€“ whereas, statements based on empirical theories, such as, say, general relativity or 
evolutionary biology, do not hold in all possible worlds, and may eventually turn out not to hold in this world as well. That is why formal sciences are applicable in 
all domains and useful in all empirical sciences.</p>

Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of axioms and definitions from which other statements (theorems) are deduced.
 For this reason, in Rudolf Carnap's logical-positivist conception of the epistemology of science, theories belonging to formal sciences are understood to contain no 
synthetic statements, being that instead all their statements are analytic. </font></p></dd></dl></ul>
