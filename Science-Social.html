	<dd><font size=4>Social science, any branch of academic study or science that deals with human behaviour in its social and cultural aspects. Usually included 
within the social sciences are cultural (or social) anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. The discipline of historiography is regarded by
 many as a social science, and certain areas of historical study are almost indistinguishable from work done in the social sciences. Most historians, however, consider 
history as one of the humanities. In the United States, focused programs, such as African-American Studies, Latinx Studies, Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, are,
 as a rule, also included among the social sciences, as are often Latin American Studies and Middle Eastern Studies, while, for instance, French, German, or Italian Studies
 are commonly associated with humanities. In the past, Sovietology was always considered a social science discipline, in contrast to Russian Studies.

<p>Beginning in the 1950s, the term behavioral sciences was often applied to the disciplines designated as the social sciences. Those who favoured this term did so in 
part because these disciplines were thus brought closer to some of the sciences, such as physical anthropology and physiological psychology, which also deal with 
human behaviour.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the social sciences, as distinct and recognized academic disciplines, emerged only on the cusp of the 20th century. But one must go back farther 
in time for the origins of some of their fundamental ideas and objectives. In the largest sense, the origins go all the way back to the ancient Greeks and their rationalist 
inquiries into human nature, the state, and morality. The heritage of both Greece and Rome is a powerful one in the history of social thought, as it is in other areas of 
Western society. Very probably, apart from the initial Greek determination to study all things in the spirit of dispassionate and rational inquiry, there would be no social 
sciences today. True, there have been long periods of time, as during the Western Middle Ages, when the Greek rationalist temper was lacking. But the recovery of this
 temper, through texts of the great classical philosophers, is the very essence of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment in modern European history. With the 
Enlightenment, in the 17th and 18th centuries, one may begin.</P></font></p></dd></dl></ul>
